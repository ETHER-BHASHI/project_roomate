#Project Roommate

Room mate pairing is an application by Celestial Biscuit, Igdtuw for Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University hostellers to choose their hostel mates according to their preferences and matches.

Our application  upends traditional hostel culture where we don't know whom we have to share room and regret later. Instead, our application brings that diverse pool that you may — or may not — have had access and can directly talk to and choose your room mate!

To use our application, you must create a profile, noting your current location, gender, age, hobbies and courses . Then you begin swiping. After you see someone's photo and a small biography, you can either swipe left if you dislike them or right if you do like them. If another person swipes right, both of you are matched, and you can begin chatting with one another. 

Our application has the following features: 
1) User Login and Registration:  It is a very user friendly process as the user. They just need to enter their name, username , emailid and password and Bravo their account is made ! Users can signup using Google and Facebook too.Its  authenticated so  it is safe and secure.
2) Security: we have a 2 step verification so after making an account opt will be given to the user to make it more secure.
3) Preference: The user will input their interest, state , branch, hobbies,  course, goal , year and then they need to give  preference to their roommates .
4) Matching:  After you see someone's photo and a small biography, you can either swipe left if you dislike them or right if you do like them. If another person swipes right, both of you are matched.
5) Messages : our application offers free chat with other students wherever they go! However, only members who have indicated a mutual interest in one another are allowed to chat. If you don’t have any matches yet, it's only a matter of time.
6) User profile and settings: This feature will allow users to view and edit their account information, and manage their notifications. Users can click on the Notifications option, to get notified on when that are matched with someone with same interest.
